# SuddenPlusCalculator
Afraid to play those songs with variable BPMs because you don't know where to set your Sudden number?

You're in luck! There's an app for that now! Although there are plenty more out there...

## Why another Sudden+ calculator?
Because I need something to do.  That and I don't really like the apps that are currently out there, so here I am making one.

## Requirements
The app currently requires Oreo on your phone to use. The next minor release should bring this back to Lollipop. 

## Contributing
Requires Android Studio 3.0 as this project is in Kotlin. You'll also need a phone that is on Android O.

1) Fork this repo.
2) Make your changes and include appropriate tests.
3) Run the tests to make sure they're all passing.
4) Open a PR against my repo.

## Have an issue? Bug report? Feature request?
Please search the issues to see if there is an open one that pertains to you. Also take a look at the [project page](https://github.com/duraz0rz/SuddenPlusCalculator/projects) to get an idea of what I've thought of so far. 
1.0 release is first...the other two are for after 1.0.

Otherwise, go ahead and submit one! If you feel it fits under an appropriate project, go ahead and tag it.
